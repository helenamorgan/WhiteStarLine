**User documentation for the software:**<br>
This software is a model that produces an graphical user interface (GUI) <br>
of the total volume and mass of an iceberg and whether this iceberg is within the range that it can be towed out of the way.<br>
This GUI model is intended to be utilised by the user to understand the true size of an iceberg from lidar and radar data files.<br>
This is intended to be a simple model with minimal functionality with a simple GUI that is very user friendly and intuative.<br>
A user runs the code with the input files and the GUI is produced informing the user of the key information on the iceberg.<br>
The users can then analyse this information to inform the ship to change course or that the tug boat will tow the iceberg out of the ships course.<br>
